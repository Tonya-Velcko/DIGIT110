            <verse n="1">
                <l n="1">Stare at a wall that's told a thousand tragedies</l>
                <l n="2">Holding a hand that's loved every part of me</l>
                <l n="3">A lady comes and tells me that I've got to leave</l>
                <l n="4">Right away everybody is the enemy</l>
            </verse>
            <verse n="2">
                <l n="5">Deep breaths from the room where I watch you lie</l>
                <l n="6">Any beat from your heart gets me through the night</l>
                <l n="7">You're my love, you're my death, you're my alibi</l>
                <l n="8">Say this isn't good bye</l>
            </verse>
            <chorus>
                <l n="9">Who's gonna drive me home tonight?</l>
                <l n="10">Who's gonna argue 'til they win the fight?</l>
                <l n="11">You're the only one that knows how to operate</l>
                <l n="12">My heavy machinery</l>
            </chorus>
            <refrain>
                <l n="13">Don't let the light go out</l>

                <l n="15">Don't let the light go out</l>

            </refrain>
            <verse n="3">
                <l n="17">A rush of blood floods hot thoughts in my head</l>
                <l n="18">Red roses sitting silently beside the bed</l>
                <l n="19">I'm saying more right now than I ever said</l>
                <l n="20">Don't wanna live if the thought of loving you is dead</l>
            </verse>

                <l n="23">You're the only one that knows how to operate</l>
                <l n="24">My heavy machinery, so</l>
                <l n="25">Who's gonna drive me home tonight?</l>
