        >Hughes references Booker T. Washington's 1895 speech at the Cotton States and International
        Exposition in lines 5 and 6 of the poem. The famous speech was interpreted by white
        Americans to support racial segregation, however, Washington was supporting cooperation as a
        necessity of the times. He did not support segregation, but understood that nothing could be
        changed at the present time. Hughes wrote this poem as a means of reconciling "the
        reputation of Booker T. Washington as collaborator with white racists with the time period
        and place". These instances are notated in the poem using the element <rec/></note>

    <note>A red inked, circular stamp is featured near lines 6-10. It shows an eagle with wings
        spread, an olive branch clutched in the left talons and spears clutched in the right, with
        its beak, holding a long ribbon, turned to the left, and the words "The Library of Congress"
        form the border.</note>
