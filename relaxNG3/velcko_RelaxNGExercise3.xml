        <saying><ref line="1">"breaking news" is the same phrase used in journalism when covering a
                story for the first time, when usually the story has either just occurred, or is
                ongoing.</ref>
            <ref line="3"> The phrase "breaking hearts" refers to the idea of a broken heart, or
                breaking someone's heart. Merriam-Webster defines "breaking someone's heart" as
                making someone feel "great sorrow or sadness".</ref>
            <ref line="9">This line is building off of various sayings such as "no tears left to
                cry" or "all out of tears", etc. Instead of saying this though, the main character
                claims they are "all out of salt". Tears are considered "salty" because they are a
                mixture of water and salt ions. One can argue that the use of the word salt to
                represent their tears is a synecdoche.</ref>
            <ref line="12">This line is reiterating the fact that they are no longer crying over
                their ex.</ref>
            <ref line="22"
                href="https://shootingstarsouthjersey.com/2015/10/05/history-of-the-cake-smash/">The
                act of pushing one's head into a cake in this context could refer to either the
                birthday tradition or the wedding tradition. In Mexico, a child's parents will push
                their face into their first birthday cake as a way to get the child to have their
                first "bite". During the wedding reception, after the cake cutting, the bride and
                groom have the option to feed pieces of cake to each other nicely, or smash cake
                into the other's face. Both instances are now commonly considered mean spirited,
                which is why the song's main character uses it to refer to their ex and perhaps,
                events in their
                relationship.<!--tjv:the href is one of the few sites that I found that explained both traditions well. Other, more reputable (arguably) sites explained one or the other but not with enough details. This is why I chose this particular website. --></ref>
            <ref line="23">The main character compares their ex to a snake, in reference to the ex's
                nature, and "pulling my arm" to signify that the ex is an unwelcome weight dragging
                them down.</ref>
        </saying>
        <plot>
            <ref line="2">The main character is talking to her ex throughout the song, explaining
                how they are moving on from the relationship. In the previous line, they mention
                "breaking news" then in this line explain that it's "not about [the ex]", suggesting
                that, for the first time, they are doing something that is for themself, instead of
                trying to get over the ex</ref>
            <ref line="4">In the previous line, they state that they are "breaking hearts too". In
                this line they claim that they "learned it all" from their ex, both implying that
                the ex broke their heart and revealing how long they have been over the
                relationship: long enough to break multiple hearts.</ref>
            <ref line="9">As covered partly in the "saying" portion of the notes, they are letting
                their ex know that they are no longer crying over them because they have nothing
                left to cry over.</ref>
            <ref line="10">In line 9, they say they're not going to cry. Line 10 clarifies that they
                will not cry because that is exactly what their ex wants. They want the main
                character to be sad because they are gone, but that is not going to happen.</ref>
            <ref line="11">Additionally, they will not cry because they "look way too good" to do
                so. In line 7 they mention that they are wearing lipstick, so it is assumed that
                they have more makeup on as well. Crying would ruin the makeup, which plays a role
                in them looking good.</ref>
            <ref line="22">After referencing being pushed into a cake, they say "no more". This is
                the character saying they will not let anyone ruin their celebrations and happiness,
                especially not their ex.</ref>
            <ref line="23 24">In these two lines, the character compares their "snake" ex to their
                snakeskin purse. The snakeskin's presence on the purse requires the snake to be,
                firstly,dead, and secondly, no longer a threat. This means that their ex is as
                relevant to them as the snakeskin on their purse: dead, and no longer a
                problem.</ref>
        </plot>
        <popCulRef>
            <ref line="5">Wonder Woman is a popular DC superhero. In the same line, the main
                character references thigh-high boots, which Wonder Woman famously wears.</ref>
            <ref line="7">This refers to Marilyn Monroe, an actress from the 1950s and 60s known for
                her beauty.</ref>
            <ref line="24">Saint Laurent is a fashion company that makes, among many other things,
                purses.</ref>
        </popCulRef>
        <aka>
            <ref line="5">"thigh-highs" refer to a boot that covers from foot to mid-thigh or
                higher.</ref>
