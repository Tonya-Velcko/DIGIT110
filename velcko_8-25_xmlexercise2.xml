        <line>Every <month>October</month> it becomes important, no, <emp>necessary</emp></line>
        <line>to see the <rep n="1.1">leaves turning</rep>, to be surrounded</line>
        <line>by <rep n="1.2">leaves turning</rep>; it's not just the symbolism,</line>
        <line>to confront in the death of the year your death,</line>
        <line>one blazing farewell appearance, though the irony </line>
        <line>isn't lost on you that <lit type="pers">nature is most seductive</lit></line>
        <line>when it's about to die, flaunting the dazzle of its </line>
        <line>incipient exit, an ending that at least so far </line>
        <line>the effects of human progress (pollution, acid rain)</line>
        <line>have not yet frightened you enough to make you believe</line>
        <line>is real; that is, you know this ending is a deception</line>
        <line>because of course <lit type="pers">nature is always renewing itself</lit>—</line>

        <line>Is it deliberate how far they make you
            go<!-- tjv: would the "they" be refering to the trees, or humans, I wonder? --></line>
        <line>especially if you live in the city to get far </line>
        <line>enough away from home to see not just trees </line>
        <line>but only trees? The boring highways, roadsigns, high </line>
        <line>speeds, 10-axle trucks passing you as if they were </line>
        <line>in an even greater hurry than you to look at leaves:</line>
        <line>so you drive in terror for literal hours and it looks </line>
        <line>like rain, or <emp>snow</emp>, but it's probably just clouds</line>
        <line>(too cloudy to see any color?) and you wonder, </line>
        <line>given the poverty of your memory, which road had the </line>
        <line>most color last year, but it doesn't matter since </line>
        <line>you're probably too late anyway, or too early—</line>
        <ind>
            <line>whichever road you take will be the wrong one</line>

        <line>a cloud will move and the <lit type="pers">sun will muscle through</lit></line>
        <line>and ignite the hills. It may not <rep n="3.1">last</rep>. Probably</line>
